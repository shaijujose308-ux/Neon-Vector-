__Neon Vector__

A fast-paced, high-fidelity arcade survival game built for the web. Control a sleek neon interceptor, dodge geometric invaders, and harvest energy fragments to maintain your shields.

__🚀 Features__

Fluid Controls: Optimized for both touch screens and mouse precision using easing algorithms.
Dynamic Difficulty: The game intensity scales linearly with your score, challenging your reflexes.
Retro-Neon Aesthetic: High-performance HTML5 Canvas rendering with particle systems and glow effects.

Lightweight: Zero dependencies, built with pure HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind), and Vanilla JavaScript.
